# Module 20 Report

## Overview of the Analysis
The analysis of loan data considered various factors including the loan size, interest rate, borrower's income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts held by the borrower, derogatory marks against the borrower, and total debt. The dataset, consisting of 77,537 data points, was divided into training and testing sets. The training set was utilized to create an initial logistic regression model (Logistic Regression Model 1) using the LogisticRegression module from scikit-learn. This model was then applied to the testing dataset to determine if loan status to unqie borrower was low or high risk.
